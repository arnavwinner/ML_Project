# Face Recognition for Attendance System

This Machine Learning Project is under the course CS550 (instructed by Gagan Raj Gupta). The project aims to revolutionize the hassle of the crucial attendance system in managing certain day-to-day activities in college academics, clubs, seminars, etc., enabling us to maintain students' statistics about their activity.

The members of this project are as follows:

1. `Abhishek Kumar`: 12140040, CSE
2. `Aditya Tiwari`: 12140090, CSE
3. `Arnav Gautam`: 12140280, CSE

This project will comprise two phases: Phase-1 and Phase-2

## Phase-1

1. **Abhishek Malik (12140040) -**
	Imported Pretrained FaceNet model and Applied to the DataSet
2. **Aditya Tiwari (12140090) -**
	Built a new CNN model from scratch and Applied to the DataSet
3. **Arnav Gautam (12140280) -**
	Imported Pretrained Deepface model and Applied to the DataSet

For Phase-1 we added 15 classes from course CS550 (different persons) pictures for our models to train on them.
